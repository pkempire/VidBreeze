VidBreeze (shutdown)

Weekend project to get instant summaries for any video/podcast by entering the link - powered by Youtube API for getting transcripts and OpenAI API for summarizing. Used a template for frontend and wrote some code for chunking long vids to minimize token usage. Had a working website up and running.
